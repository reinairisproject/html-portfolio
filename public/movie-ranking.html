<h1>Reina's personal favourite movies so far</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. A Star is Born</h3>
<p>
    It's probably the only movie that I sobbed HARD watching.<br />
    Very memorable.
</p>
<h3>2. Kimi no Na Wa</h3>
<p>
    To be honest I don't watch movies that often but I liked how this movie kind of reminded me of Steins:Gate with the time travelling aspect.<br />
    Visually stunning.
</p>
<h3>3. Incidious series</h3>
<p>
    I generally quite enjoy horror movies. This one actually had a well thought out storyline in my opinion. <br />
    I liked the fact it didn't just rely on gore or jumpscares.
